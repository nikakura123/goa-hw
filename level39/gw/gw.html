In fall 2022
, the World Bank will update the International Poverty Line from $1.90 to $2.15.
this means anyone living on less than $2.15 is in “extreme poverty.” 
Why the change? Increases in the costs of food, 
clothing, and shelter between 2011-2017 make the “real value of $2.15 in 2017
prices equal to $1.90 in 2011 prices.
As for the World Bank’s goal to reduce extreme poverty to 3% or less by 2030, 
the pandemic has made it even harder. 
Extreme poverty isn’t the only poverty we have to contend with. 
62% of the global population lives on less than $10/day. 
While there’s been progress over the years,
the end of poverty is still far off.

        Corruption is a major problem in Georgia. 
        The country has a long history of corruption, 
        and it is still a major issue today. 
        Corruption is a problem in many areas of Georgian society, 
        including the government, the police, the judiciary, 
        and the business sector. 
        Corruption is a major obstacle to economic development in Georgia,

<h1>Food insecurity</h1>
<b><p>
    According to the 2022 Global Report on Food Crises, 
    which is produced by the Global Network against Food Crises, 
    the number of people in crisis or 
    worse is the highest it’s been in the six years since the report has existed. 
    Close to 193 million people were experiencing acute food insecurity in 2021, 
    which is an increase of almost 40 million since 2020. 
    This represents a staggering 80% increase since 2016. 
    Causes include “economic shocks,” like an increase in global food prices.
    Domestic food price inflation in low-income countries also rose a lot. 
    “Weather-related disasters” are also a big driver. 
    For 15.7 million people in 15 countries, 
    it was the primary driver of acute food insecurity.

    <h1>Refugee rights</h1>
        <b><p>
        According to UNHCR, the war in Ukraine sparked the fastest-growing refugee crisis since WWII. 
        Almost 6 million (as of May 10, 2022) people have fled. 
        The UNCHR’s Refugee Brief, which compiles the week’s biggest refugee stories, 
        has recently described situations in places like Somalia, 
        where thousands of people were displaced due to severe drought. 
        Between January and mid-April, more than 36,000 refugees from Nigeria, 
        Mali, and Burkina Faso arrived in Niger. 
        These are only a few examples of the refugee crises, which endangers already marginalized groups – like women and children – and puts them at an increased risk of trafficking, violence, and death.

    <h1>COVID-19</h1>
    <b><p>
    The WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic in March 2022. 
    It will continue to be a major issue for the world. 
    The WEF’s Global Risks Report 2022 discusses COVID’s effects at length, 
    including major economic recovery disparities and social erosion. 
    According to a January 2022 article from NPR, 
    there are also issues with vaccinations as many countries continue to have trouble getting doses. 
    Distribution, vaccine hesitancy, healthcare systems, 
    and other problems also factor into low vaccination rates. 
    While we may never know the exact impact, 
    the WHO estimates that between 1 January 2020 and 31 December 2021, 
    there were around 14.9 million excess deaths linked to COVID-19.

    <h1>Future pandemic preparation and response</h1>
    
    <b><p>
        COVID-19 taught the world the importance of prepardeness. 
        In a Harvard blog, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, 
        director-general of the WHO, outlined the lessons the world should take to heart. 
        The first: science has to guide policy. 
        The politicization of the pandemic led to a lot of unnecessary damage. 
        Another lesson is that science must pair with equity or it can actually make inequalities worse. 
        This is obvious when looking at how low-income countries struggled to get the vaccines while wealthier countries stocked up. 
        More resilient healthcare systems are also a must, 
        as well as more coherent, global plans on how to respond. 
        The world must also invest in research on contagious diseases, zoonotic diseases, 
        the effectiveness of outbreak responses, and more.

    <h1>Healthcare</h1>
    
    <b><p>
        The healthcare industry has experienced major shifts due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
        According to the World Economic Forum, there’s been new investments and innovations, 
        especially from the technology and telehealth sectors. 
        In 2021, $44 billion was spent on health innovation. 
        The world will be seeing the effects of these innovations for years to come, 
        though equity will no doubt be a major issue. In places like the United States, 
        the pandemic also reaffirmed how broken healthcare systems can be. 
        In an MIT News blog, Andrea Campbell, a professor of political science, 
        says the pandemic revealed a “dire need” for investments in public-health infrastructure, 
        as well as a need to expand healthcare access and insurance coverage.

    <h1>Mental health</h1>
    <b><p>
    Globally, almost 1 billion people have some form of mental disorder. 
    The pandemic made the world’s mental health worse. 
    According to a scientific brief from the WHO, there’s been a 25% increase in anxiety and depression worldwide. 
    Causes include social isolation, fear of sickness, grief, and financial anxieties. 
    Health workers were also severely impacted, as well as young women and girls. 
    The brief also highlights how the pandemic disrupted many mental health services, 
    including services for substance abuse. 
    Countries need to ensure access to mental health services as part of their COVID-19 recovery plans and beyond. 
    It’s an economic decision, as well. The Lancet states that anxiety and depression alone cost the global economy around $1 trillion a year.

    <h1>Disability rights</h1>
    <b><p>
    According to the WHO, over 1 billion people have some form of disability. 
    Half can’t afford healthcare. 
    They’re also more likely to live in poverty than those without a disability, 
    have poorer health outcomes, and have less access to work and education opportunities. 
    Human Rights Watch lists other discriminations disabled people face, 
    such as an increased risk of violence. 
    There’s been progress regarding disability rights, 
    but many countries lack strong protections. 
    The world still has a long way to go to ensure equality for those with disabilities.

    <h1>Reproductive justice</h1>
    <b><p>
    Reproductive justice – which encompasses more than just abortion rights – is threatened by legislation, 
    lack of funding, lack of education, and restricted healthcare access. In most places, 
    wealth is a big determinant of whether a person can access reproductive services. 
    It’s better in some places than others, 
    but as we’ve seen with other issues on this list, 
    even “progressive” countries like the United States are experiencing major shifts. 
    In June 2022, the Supreme Court is expected to overrule Roe v. Wade, 
    a milestone court case that protected a pregnant woman’s right to abortion. 
    The impact would be immediate and will likely influence other countries.
